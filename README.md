# Python Projects  
These are codes that I've been making so far while learning python.
Some example of Python projects I completed include:
- Guessing Games
- Functional Array Stack
- Finding Cost of Gas
- and more!

I hope to create more and more complex code but for now I will slowly work my way there.
I hope I can learn many things to get better!
